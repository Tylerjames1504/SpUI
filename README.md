## SpUI is a project that extends SamTheCoder777's original Custom-Spotify-Manager project. It is a JavaFX application that not only gives more power over playlist customization, but also displays user data that is hidden in the Spotify app. 
## Original Project GitHub repo: *https://github.com/SamTheCoder777/Custom-Spotify-Manager*

### The original project is a TUI, it runs in the command line and is not very user-friendly. 
### We wanted to make this project more user-friendly, add more features, bug fix, and learn and add unit testing with JUnit and TestFX.
### This project uses a Java Spotify Web API wrapper to abstract most of the actual API work, check it out here: *https://github.com/spotify-web-api-java/spotify-web-api-java*

#### SpUI was created as a term project in Introduction to Software Engineering, a class that aims to teach the basics of software engineering and project management.
